# 116 Artifact delivery pipeline for Sandy agent outputs

## Problem
Image generation works inside the Sandy sandbox, but the chat UI often shows broken images or nothing. The current agent output may print large base64 data URLs that get truncated, and artifacts stored in the sandbox can disappear before the UI can fetch them. We need a reliable, deterministic pipeline to transport binary outputs (images, files) from sandbox to UI.

## Goals
- **Reliable artifacts**: Images and files generated by the agent are available to the UI 100% of the time.
- **No giant base64 in stdout**: Agents should save binaries to `/workspace/artifacts` and avoid printing large data URLs.
- **Persisted cache**: Node server downloads artifacts into a persistent disk (`/var/data`) and serves them as static files.
- **Stream friendly**: UI should render images as soon as artifacts arrive.

## Non‑Goals
- No changes to Sandy sandbox artifact server internals.
- No changes to Chutes APIs.

## Desired Architecture
1. **Agent behavior**
   - When producing images/files, save them to `/workspace/artifacts/<filename>`.
   - Print a short confirmation only (no base64 blobs).

2. **Baseline service (Janus)**
   - Collect artifacts from `/workspace/artifacts` after agent run completes.
   - Emit `janus` SSE events: `artifacts` with file metadata + URL to sandbox.

3. **UI (Node server + client)**
   - When receiving `artifacts` events, the client calls a server route to cache files.
   - Server downloads files from sandbox URLs into `/var/data/janus-artifacts/<chatId>/...`.
   - Server serves cached files from `/api/artifacts/<chatId>/<file>`.
   - Client updates artifact URLs to `/api/artifacts/...` and renders them via `MediaRenderer`.

## Implementation Notes
- **Cache route**: `POST /api/artifacts/cache` with `{ chatId, artifact }` returns cached URL.
- **Serve route**: `GET /api/artifacts/[...path]` streams file from `/var/data` with correct content type.
- **Fallback**: If caching fails, continue to use the original artifact URL.
- **No inline images**: sandbox artifact collection should always emit URLs for images (avoid `data:` base64) so the UI can cache reliably.
- **Grace period**: keep the sandbox alive briefly after emitting artifacts so the UI can download before termination.

## Test Plan
- **API**: Stream `janus-baseline-agent` for image generation; ensure `artifacts` event emitted.
- **UI**: Send “Generate a cute cat image” and confirm `img` renders from `/api/artifacts/...`.
- **Repeatability**: Run the prompt 10x; success rate should be 100%.

## Rollout
- Update system prompt to save outputs to `/workspace/artifacts`.
- Deploy baseline-agent and UI.
- Verify via Playwright that images render reliably.
