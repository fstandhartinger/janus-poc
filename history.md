# History

## 2026-01-23
- Implemented 33 specs, then added the history file, no details about 1-33 to be expected for this reason, but see here to understand progress and decide if a certain spec is to be skipped be cause we just tried too hard (too often) and don't want to get stuck on one. If we tried one spec 10 times and still didn't suceed in implementing it, lets split it into simpler subspecs and continue.
