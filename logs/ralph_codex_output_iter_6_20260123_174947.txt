Added the five-step competition flow and a full prize pool section (widget, diagram, rules, transparency) on the competition page to satisfy the process/prize pool spec; used speckit-implement to follow the Ralph loop for the highest-priority competition spec. The pool snapshot and formatting live in `ui/src/app/competition/components/prizePoolData.ts`, the new section is in `ui/src/app/competition/components/PrizePool.tsx`, and the five-step update plus Earn subtext is in `ui/src/app/competition/components/HowItWorks.tsx`, with page wiring in `ui/src/app/competition/page.tsx` and exports in `ui/src/app/competition/components/index.ts`. FAQ prize pool rules were updated in `ui/src/app/competition/components/FAQ.tsx`, the leaderboard anchor added in `ui/src/app/competition/components/Leaderboard.tsx`, Playwright coverage tightened in `ui/e2e/competition.spec.ts`, and the spec was marked complete in `specs/competition/03_steps_and_prize_pool.md`.
