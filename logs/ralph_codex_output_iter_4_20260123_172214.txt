Using skills: read-context (load constitution/AGENTS) and speckit-implement (Ralph loop implementation).

Marked the competition spec index as complete by updating the status line in `specs/competition/00_index.md` so the index spec is now closed.

Tests:
- `pytest` (gateway)
- `mypy janus_gateway` (gateway)
- `npm test` (ui)
- `npm run typecheck` (ui)

Notes:
- Commit/push: `fc6fa43`.
- Pre-existing uncommitted changes in the repo were left untouched and not included.
- No UI changes here, so no manual visual pass beyond Playwright tests.

Next step: run the next Ralph iteration for the next incomplete spec (likely `specs/competition/02_description_and_scoring.md`).
