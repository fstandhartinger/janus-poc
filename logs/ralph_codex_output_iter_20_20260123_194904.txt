Using the `speckit-implement` skill to follow the Ralph spec loop. I checked the worktree and found pre‑existing changes I didn’t make (e.g., baseline rename already in progress under `baseline-agent-cli/`, plus edits in `render.yaml`, `gateway/janus_gateway/config/settings.py`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/runbook.md`, `bench/janus_bench/cli.py`, and some UI files, with untracked `.codex/`, `logs/`, and `ui/public/Janus_God_and_Bull_Video_Generation.mp4`). Per instructions I need your direction before proceeding—should I continue from this state as in‑progress work, or should I stash/clean/commit those changes first?
