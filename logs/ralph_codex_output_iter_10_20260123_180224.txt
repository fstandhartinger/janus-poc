Using `speckit-implement` to follow Ralph Build Mode and re-verify `specs/03_components.md`.

Added a test matrix and an explicit chutes-knowledge-agent reference in `README.md` to make the component/test mapping and reuse signals explicit for the components spec. This keeps the documentation aligned with the spec’s acceptance criteria without changing code paths.

- `README.md`: added test matrix table under Testing; added `chutes-knowledge-agent` to Related Projects.

**Tests**
- `cd gateway && pytest` (initial run timed out at 120s; reran successfully)
- `cd ui && npm run build`
- `cd ui && npm test`
- `cd gateway && mypy janus_gateway`
- `cd ui && npm run typecheck`

I noticed unexpected, pre-existing changes in the working tree that I didn’t make:
- Modified: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `specs/11_chat_ui.md`, `specs/competition/02_description_and_scoring.md`, `ui/src/app/competition/components/ScoringBreakdown.tsx`
- Untracked: `.claude/commands/speckit.implement.md`, `.claude/commands/speckit.specify.md`, `.codex/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, `logs/`, `ui/src/app/competition/components/CompetitionOverview.tsx`

How would you like me to proceed?
1) Commit only `README.md` and ignore the other changes  
2) Include all current changes in the commit  
3) Pause and review the unexpected changes together
