Using `speckit-implement` to follow the Ralph build loop you requested.

I hit unexpected, pre-existing changes in the worktree (per instructions I need your direction before proceeding), including:
- Large rename set `baseline/` → `baseline-agent-cli/` plus edits across `baseline-agent-cli/`.
- Updates in `render.yaml`, `gateway/janus_gateway/config/settings.py`, `gateway/tests/test_competitor_registry.py`, `bench/janus_bench/*`, and docs (`README.md`, `docs/*`).
- Multiple spec edits in `specs/*`.
- UI changes in `ui/src/app/*`, plus untracked `.codex/`, `logs/`, and `ui/public/Janus_God_and_Bull_Video_Generation.mp4`.

How would you like me to proceed?
1) Treat these as in‑progress and continue with Spec 26 using them.
2) Stop and clean/stash/revert before proceeding.
3) Something else (tell me the exact approach).

Also, I started `./scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh` and it appears to still be running; do you want me to stop it?
