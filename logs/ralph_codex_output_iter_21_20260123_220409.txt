Implemented judge configuration plus a research-scoring helper module and generator script to complete Spec 31, and marked it COMPLETE.

**Changes**
- Added judge + subset settings in `bench/janus_bench/config.py` and introduced research scoring utilities in `bench/janus_bench/scorers/research.py` with exports in `bench/janus_bench/scorers/__init__.py`.
- Added the research items generator at `scripts/generate_research_items.py` and a research scoring override test in `bench/tests/test_runner.py`.
- Updated `specs/31_janus_research_benchmark.md` to COMPLETE.

**Tests**
- `cd bench && pytest`
- `cd gateway && pytest` (long-running keep-alive test; ~3 minutes)
- `cd ui && npm test`
- `cd gateway && mypy janus_gateway`
- `cd ui && npm run typecheck`

**Notes**
- Warnings seen: Next.js outputFileTracingRoot warning during Playwright; Starlette PendingDeprecationWarning in gateway tests.
- There are unrelated local modifications/untracked files in the repo; I did not stage or commit them.
