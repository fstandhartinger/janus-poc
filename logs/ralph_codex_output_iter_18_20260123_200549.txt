I ran into unexpected pre‑existing changes in the repo (baseline‑agent‑cli, bench, specs, ui, etc.) that I didn’t touch. Per your instructions I need guidance before committing/pushing. How would you like me to proceed?

1) Commit only the changes I made (baseline‑langchain + gateway/docs/README updates)  
2) Include all existing changes in the commit  
3) Pause while you clean up the worktree

Tests already run (in case you want to proceed): `baseline-langchain` pytest + mypy, `gateway` pytest + mypy, `ui` npm test + typecheck.
