Using skills `read-context` and `speckit-implement` (read required context, then run the Ralph spec loop). I just noticed existing changes in `baseline/janus_baseline/services/complexity.py` that I didn’t make (it already contains multimodal keywords, a `ComplexityAnalysis` dataclass, and new logic). How would you like me to proceed—treat those as in‑progress and continue, or stop and revert/inspect them first?
