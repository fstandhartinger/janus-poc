Using **read-context** and **speckit-implement** for the Ralph loop; **commit-push** is queued once the repo state is clarified.

I hit a blocker: `git status` shows many pre‑existing modified/untracked files outside this spec (e.g., `baseline-agent-cli/*`, `docs/*`, `specs/*`, `.codex/`, `logs/`, etc.). Per instructions I need your direction before committing.

How should I proceed?
1) Commit only the spec 33 changes and leave everything else untouched.  
2) Include all current changes in the commit.  
3) Something else (e.g., stash/clean unrelated changes first).

Once you choose, I’ll finish the commit/push and deployment verification.
