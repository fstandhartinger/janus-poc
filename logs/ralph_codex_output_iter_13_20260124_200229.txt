Using read-context → speckit-implement → deploy-watch → verify-complete to follow the Ralph loop, track the Render deploy, and confirm production health.

- Render scoring service `DATABASE_URL` updated to use `ssl=require`; deploy `dep-d5qiaqngi27c73fdjp70` is live
- Production checks on `https://janus-scoring-service.onrender.com`: `/health` 200, `/api/leaderboard` 200 ([]), `/api/runs` 200 ([]), `/api/competitors` 200 ([])
- No code changes in this step; repo still has unrelated local changes (left untouched). Skipped `autonomous` because `speckit-implement` already enforces autonomy, and skipped `test-all/commit-push` because nothing changed and tests were already run previously
