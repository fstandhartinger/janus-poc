I just ran `git status` and found unexpected pre-existing changes/untracked files not related to this rename (e.g., `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `specs/11_chat_ui.md`, `specs/competition/02_description_and_scoring.md`, `ui/src/app/chat/page.tsx`, `ui/src/app/globals.css`, plus untracked `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, `logs/`, and some UI assets). Per instructions I’m stopping here.

How would you like to proceed?
1) Keep those changes and I’ll commit only the baseline rename work (selective staging)
2) Stash/clean the unrelated changes first
3) Include everything in one commit
