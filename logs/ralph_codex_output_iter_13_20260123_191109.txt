Used the `speckit-implement` skill to follow the Ralph loop for the next incomplete competition spec.

Expanded the competition FAQ to the full spec content with sections, searchable text, and helpful links; added the Component Marketplace section with the reward flow diagram, requirements, and CTAs; and added internal anchors plus updated the competition e2e check. The spec status in `specs/competition/06_faq_and_marketplace.md` is now COMPLETE.

Tests:
- `pytest` (needed a longer run for the streaming contract test)
- `mypy janus_gateway`
- `npm run build`
- `npm test`
- `npm run typecheck`

Visual checks:
- Puppeteer screenshots at 1920x1080, 768x1024, 375x812: `competition-desktop`, `competition-tablet`, `competition-mobile`

Notes:
- Next.js emitted the workspace-root/multiple-lockfile warning during build/start.
- Deployment verification not performed (no target configured here).
