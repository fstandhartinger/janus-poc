Using skill: speckit-implement to run the Ralph loop for the top incomplete spec.

Built out the competition submission documentation and requirements UI to match spec 04, then marked the spec complete and pushed. The new sections live on the competition page to keep the flow consistent with the existing layout and clarify submission expectations.

- Added a submission guide section covering what to submit, open source requirements, hotkey usage, and review process in `ui/src/app/competition/components/SubmissionGuide.tsx` and wired it into `ui/src/app/competition/page.tsx`.
- Expanded the submission form fields and examples in `ui/src/app/competition/components/SubmissionForm.tsx`.
- Updated the technical requirements accordion to include endpoint table, resource limits, and egress list in `ui/src/app/competition/components/TechRequirements.tsx`.
- Marked the spec complete in `specs/competition/04_submission_and_open_source.md`.

Tests:
- `pytest` (gateway) (initial 120s timeout; reran successfully; warning about `python_multipart` deprecation)
- `npm test` (ui, Playwright) (warning about Next.js workspace root due to multiple lockfiles)
- `mypy janus_gateway`
- `npm run typecheck`

Visual checks:
- Headless Puppeteer screenshots captured for `/competition` at 1920x1080, 768x1024, and 375x812.

Next steps:
1. Continue with `specs/competition/05_architecture_overview.md`.
