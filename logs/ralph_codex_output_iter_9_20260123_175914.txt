Using read-context and speckit-implement to follow the Ralph loop and perform the requested re-verification.

**Re-verification**
- Randomly selected `specs/00_overview.md` and checked all acceptance criteria.
- Confirmed Sandy, chutes-knowledge-agent, and chutes-bench-runner references across specs.
- Confirmed OpenAPI specs exist in `specs/openapi/`.
- Confirmed more than three Mermaid diagrams across the spec suite.
- Tests: none specified in `specs/00_overview.md`, so none run.
