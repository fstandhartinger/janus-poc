Updated the “Why Janus?” landing section to split user vs builder benefits, added the new “Always Improving” card, and introduced audience-specific styling so the badges/hover states read clearly. Changes are in `ui/src/components/landing/FeatureCards.tsx`, `ui/src/app/globals.css`, `specs/51_why_janus_section_clarity.md`, and `history.md`.

Validation done:
- Tests: `gateway/.venv/bin/pytest`, `gateway/.venv/bin/mypy janus_gateway`, `ui npm test`, `ui npm run typecheck`
- Visual checks (Playwright, Why Janus section):

Blocking issue: the repo has a large number of pre-existing/unrelated changes (modified/deleted specs, baseline files, scripts, etc.). Per instructions, I need your direction before committing/pushing. How do you want to proceed?
1) Commit only my changes (the four files above) and ignore everything else  
2) Include all current changes in this commit  
3) Pause so you can clean/stash, then I’ll commit/push

Once you confirm, I’ll proceed with commit/push, Render deploy watch, and Telegram text/audio + mermaid diagram upload.
