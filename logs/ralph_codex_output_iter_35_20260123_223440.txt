Using `speckit-implement` to follow the Ralph loop (covers build/test/commit/deploy); not invoking separate commit/push/test-all skills.

Tool-use benchmark is now fully wired with structured items, tool-call parsing, and scoring logic, and the spec is marked complete. I added tool-use scorers + simulator, populated the 80-item dataset with the four required task types, and integrated tool-call capture/override scoring in the runner. Updated files: `bench/janus_bench/runner.py`, `bench/janus_bench/scorers/__init__.py`, `bench/janus_bench/scorers/tool_use.py`, `bench/janus_bench/tool_simulator.py`, `bench/janus_bench/datasets/data/janus/tool_use_items.json`, `bench/tests/test_tool_use_scorer.py`, `specs/32_janus_tool_use_benchmark.md`.

Tests run:
- `pytest` (in `bench`)  
- `pytest` (in `gateway`)  
- `npm test` (in `ui`)  
- `mypy janus_gateway`  
- `npm run typecheck` (in `ui`)  

Deployments (Render):
- `janus-gateway` deploy `dep-d5puu2pr0fns73bqfrag` is live.
- `janus-ui` deploy `dep-d5puu39r0fns73bqfrmg` failed: Module not found `./CompetitionOverview` from `ui/src/app/competition/components/index.ts`. Note: `ui/src/app/competition/components/CompetitionOverview.tsx` exists locally but is untracked, so it isn’t in the repo/Render build.
- `janus-baseline` deploy `dep-d5puu31r0fns73bqfrfg` failed: `cd baseline: No such file or directory` (Render build command points at a missing `baseline/` dir).

Production checks (gateway):
- `GET /health` OK
- `GET /v1/models` OK
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` OK (returns assistant response)

I can’t complete the full deployment verification (UI + baseline are failing), so I’m not emitting `<promise>DONE</promise>` yet. How do you want to handle those two deploy failures?

Suggested next steps:
1. I can fix the UI build by committing `ui/src/app/competition/components/CompetitionOverview.tsx` or removing the import from `ui/src/app/competition/components/index.ts`.
2. I can update the Render baseline service to point at the correct directory (or restore a `baseline/` folder if that’s intended).
