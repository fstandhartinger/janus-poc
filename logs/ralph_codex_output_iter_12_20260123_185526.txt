Using speckit-implement + read-context to follow the Ralph loop and load project principles.

Added the shared navigation header to the chat page and adjusted the chat shell/sidebar sizing so the interface fills the viewport beneath the header.
- `ui/src/app/chat/page.tsx`: wrapped `/chat` in the shared header and a flex column layout to match the multi-page nav.
- `ui/src/app/globals.css`: updated chat shell/sidebar sizing/positioning for the new header layout.

**Tests**
- `pytest` (gateway) — pass (23 tests; 1 pending deprecation warning from `starlette`).
- `mypy janus_gateway` — pass.
- `npm test` (ui Playwright) — pass.
- `npm run typecheck` — pass.
- Visual check: Playwright screenshots saved to `/tmp/janus-chat-desktop.png`, `/tmp/janus-chat-tablet.png`, `/tmp/janus-chat-mobile.png` (Puppeteer MCP failed due to missing X server).

I noticed pre-existing uncommitted changes in several files (e.g., `specs/11_chat_ui.md`, `baseline/...`, `README.md`). Per instructions I paused before committing. How should I proceed?
1) Commit only the chat layout changes (`ui/src/app/chat/page.tsx`, `ui/src/app/globals.css`).
2) Include the current `specs/11_chat_ui.md` edits along with the chat layout changes.
3) Something else — tell me which files to include.
