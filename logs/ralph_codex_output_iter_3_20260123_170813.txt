Used speckit-implement to follow the Ralph spec loop.

Updated competition page copy across `ui/src/app/competition/components` to the Rodeo/intelligence framing (removing agent/miner terms), aligned the competition e2e assertion in `ui/e2e/competition.spec.ts`, and marked the spec complete in `specs/competition/01_competition_overview.md` to satisfy the acceptance criteria.

**Tests**
- `pytest`
- `mypy janus_gateway`
- `npm run build`
- `npm test`
- `npm run typecheck`

**Visuals**
- Puppeteer screenshots: `competition-desktop-final` (1920x1080), `competition-tablet-final` (768x1024), `competition-mobile-final` (375x812)

**Deploy**
- Render `janus-ui` deploy `dep-d5pq2hili9vc73c14b60` is live; verified `https://janus-ui.onrender.com/competition` contains the new Rodeo/intelligence copy.
- Build logs show no errors (only npm audit warnings from dependencies).

**Notes**
- Uncommitted pre-existing changes remain in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `specs/11_chat_ui.md`, plus untracked `.codex/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, `logs/`, `render.yaml`, `.claude/commands/*`.
- Render shows a newer commit `fc6fa43` (“Mark competition spec index complete”) deployed after my changes — is that expected?
