Using `speckit-implement` to run the Ralph loop; `notify-telegram` is queued once the git state is clarified.

Updated the baseline agent system prompt to the enhanced spec (including file URL patterns and updated docs list), wired sandbox env exports for Chutes/artifact URLs with a new `chutes_api_key` setting, and synced prompt tests plus history/spec status for spec 41. The prompt update is applied both in `baseline-agent-cli/janus_baseline_agent_cli/prompts/system.md` and the shipped agent-pack prompt so runtime behavior matches the spec.

Tests run:
- `pytest` (in `baseline-agent-cli`)
- `.venv/bin/pytest` (in `gateway`)
- `.venv/bin/mypy janus_gateway` (in `gateway`)
- `npm test` (in `ui`)
- `npm run typecheck` (in `ui`)

I noticed a bunch of pre-existing, unrelated changes in the worktree (e.g. `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, multiple baseline files, specs 38, etc.). Per instructions I need your direction before committing. How should I proceed?
1) Commit only my spec‑41 changes and leave the unrelated modifications untouched.  
2) Include all current changes in one commit.  
3) Pause while you clean the working tree, then I’ll commit.

Once you confirm, I’ll commit/push, watch the Render deploy, and send the Telegram text+audio updates.
