Using speckit-implement to run the Ralph loop for spec 21.

Implemented the enhanced baseline agent pack and wired Sandy to upload and bootstrap it before running a lightweight CLI agent, plus added config toggles and integration tests so the new docs and prompt are exercised end‑to‑end.

- Added agent pack docs, prompt, bootstrap, and runner in `baseline/agent-pack/` and mirrored the prompt in `baseline/janus_baseline/prompts/system.md` to match the spec.
- Updated Sandy execution to upload the pack, run bootstrap, and launch the agent with capability flags in `baseline/janus_baseline/services/sandy.py`.
- Added agent pack settings (and enabled populate-by-name) in `baseline/janus_baseline/config.py` and documented new env vars in `baseline/README.md`.
- Added unit/integration tests covering docs, prompt, bootstrap, and agent behavior in `baseline/tests/test_agent_pack.py`; marked `specs/21_enhanced_baseline.md` complete.

Tests run:
- `pytest` (baseline)
- `pytest` (gateway)
- `npm test` (ui)
- `mypy janus_gateway`
- `npm run typecheck`

Note: there are pre-existing, unrelated changes not touched by this commit (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `specs/11_chat_ui.md`, plus untracked `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, `logs/`, `render.yaml`, `specs/22_ui_polish.md`). Let me know if you want those handled.
