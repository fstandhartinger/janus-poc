Implemented the full Competition page experience with an interactive leaderboard, scoring breakdown, architecture diagram, requirements accordion, bench-runner section, submission placeholder, and FAQ, plus mermaid rendering and Playwright coverage for the new route. Used the speckit-implement loop to complete the highest‑priority spec.

**Details**
- Composed the new competition layout in `ui/src/app/competition/page.tsx` and added section components in `ui/src/app/competition/components/` to cover hero, leaderboard, scoring, architecture, requirements, bench runner, submission, and FAQ content.
- Added Mermaid rendering with lazy loading in `ui/src/app/competition/components/MermaidDiagram.tsx` and `ui/src/app/competition/components/ArchitectureOverview.tsx` to satisfy the diagram requirement.
- Introduced smooth-scroll + fade-in animations in `ui/src/app/globals.css` for the hero and section reveals.
- Added the smoke test in `ui/e2e/competition.spec.ts` and marked the spec complete in `specs/19_competition_page.md`.
- Added the `mermaid` dependency in `ui/package.json` and updated `ui/package-lock.json`.

**Tests**
- `cd ui && npm run typecheck`
- `cd ui && npm run lint` (warnings in existing files)
- `cd ui && npm run build`
- `cd ui && npm test`
- `cd gateway && pytest`
- `cd gateway && mypy janus_gateway`

**Visual Checks**
- Puppeteer screenshots: `competition-desktop` (1920x1080), `competition-tablet` (768x1024), `competition-mobile` (375x812).

**Notes**
- `npm run lint` still reports pre-existing warnings in `ui/src/components/ChatArea.tsx`, `ui/src/components/ChatInput.tsx`, `ui/src/components/MessageBubble.tsx`, and `ui/src/store/chat.ts`.
- Unrelated working tree changes remain in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `specs/11_chat_ui.md`, plus untracked `.codex/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, and `specs/20_marketplace_page.md` / `specs/21_enhanced_baseline.md`.

**Next Steps**
1. Continue the Ralph loop with `specs/20_marketplace_page.md`.
2. (Optional) Clean up the existing lint warnings in the chat UI files.
