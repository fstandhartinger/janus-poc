Using speckit-implement to follow the Ralph loop for the highest-priority incomplete spec.

The FAQ + Marketplace requirements in `ui/src/app/competition/components/FAQ.tsx`, `ui/src/app/competition/components/ComponentMarketplace.tsx`, and `ui/src/app/competition/page.tsx` already match the spec; I validated the acceptance criteria against the current UI and ran the full test + visual checks.

**Tests**
- `pytest` (gateway)  
- `mypy janus_gateway`  
- `npm test` (Playwright)  
- `npm run typecheck`  
- Visual check via Puppeteer on `/competition` at 1920x1080, 768x1024, 375x812; no warnings/errors in `/tmp/janus-next-dev.log`

**Blocking detail**
- `specs/competition/06_faq_and_marketplace.md` is flagged as `assume-unchanged` (H). `HEAD` already has `Status: COMPLETE`, but your working copy had `DRAFT` (that’s what I initially saw). I set it back to `COMPLETE`, but Git won’t show or stage it because of the flag.

How do you want to proceed?
1) Keep it `COMPLETE` and clear the assume-unchanged flag so I can commit/push.  
2) Restore your local `DRAFT` state and move on to the next spec.
