Using `read-context` + `speckit-implement` to follow the Ralph loop and required project guidelines.

Spec 29’s behavior is already implemented in the UI (hero image click opens modal, autoplay, ESC/outer click close, play/pause toggle, hover hint, focus trap, mobile inline playback), so there were no code changes to make.

Validation:
- `pytest` passed (25 tests; 1 warning about `python_multipart`).
- `npm test` passed (Playwright: 18 tests).
- `mypy janus_gateway` passed.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- Visual check via headless Puppeteer on `http://localhost:3001` with screenshots `landing-desktop`, `landing-tablet`, `landing-mobile`; `brokenImages: 0` and `resource failures: 0`.

I noticed a large set of pre-existing modified/untracked files in the repo (see `git status -sb` output) and `specs/29_hero_video_easter_egg.md` is marked assume-unchanged (`git ls-files -v` shows `H`). Per your instruction, I’m stopping and asking how you want to proceed before committing/pushing anything.

How would you like to proceed?
1) Ignore existing changes and just acknowledge Spec 29 as complete (no commit).
2) Create an empty commit to record verification of Spec 29.
3) Clean/resolve the existing changes first (you tell me which ones to keep).
