Using `speckit-implement` to re-verify spec 09 and close the missing acceptance criteria.

Implemented baseline CLI sandbox artifacts and agent selection so complex path can return artifact descriptors and run a stub Aider command, with lifecycle reasoning events preserved.
- Added artifact/env configuration + non‑streaming complex routing in `baseline-agent-cli/janus_baseline_agent_cli/config.py` and `baseline-agent-cli/janus_baseline_agent_cli/main.py`.
- Implemented agent selection, artifact collection/data URLs, and non‑streaming complex responses in `baseline-agent-cli/janus_baseline_agent_cli/services/sandy.py`.
- Added artifact server + Aider stub + artifact writes in `baseline-agent-cli/agent-pack/bootstrap.sh`, `baseline-agent-cli/agent-pack/bin/aider`, and `baseline-agent-cli/agent-pack/run_agent.py`.
- Updated artifact models and exports in `baseline-agent-cli/janus_baseline_agent_cli/models/openai.py` and `baseline-agent-cli/janus_baseline_agent_cli/models/__init__.py`.
- Added integration tests for fast path, complex path artifacts, streaming lifecycle reasoning, and timeouts in `baseline-agent-cli/tests/test_sandy_integration.py`.

Tests run:
- `pytest` (baseline-agent-cli)
- `pytest` (gateway; first run timed out at 10s, reran with longer timeout)
- `mypy janus_gateway`
- `npm test` (ui)
- `npm run typecheck` (ui)

Notes: saw the existing Next.js outputFileTracingRoot warning during Playwright, and the Starlette multipart deprecation warning in pytest.

I noticed a large set of unrelated modified/untracked files already in the repo (`git status` shows many changes outside baseline-agent-cli). Per your instruction, I’m stopping before commit/push. How would you like to proceed?
1) I stage/commit only the baseline-agent-cli changes from this task.
2) I wait and you handle the existing changes.
3) I help split/clean the working tree before committing.
