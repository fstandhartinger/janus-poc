Used skill: speckit-implement to execute the Ralph spec flow for Spec 27.

Implemented the LangChain baseline competitor and wired gateway routing/render config; marked Spec 27 complete.
- Added the LangChain baseline service with FastAPI endpoint, tools, models, and tests in `baseline-langchain/`.
- Registered the LangChain baseline in the gateway registry and model-based routing in `gateway/janus_gateway/services/competitor_registry.py` and `gateway/janus_gateway/routers/chat.py`.
- Updated gateway config/docs and Render blueprint for the new baseline in `gateway/janus_gateway/config/settings.py`, `gateway/README.md`, and `render.yaml`.
- Marked the spec complete in `specs/27_baseline_langchain.md`.

**Tests**
- `cd baseline-langchain && .venv/bin/pytest`
- `cd gateway && .venv/bin/pytest`
- `cd gateway && .venv/bin/mypy janus_gateway`
- `cd ui && npm test`
- `cd ui && npm run typecheck`

**Open Items**
- Render health check for `https://janus-baseline-langchain.onrender.com/health` returned 404, so deployment verification is still pending (not outputting `<promise>DONE</promise>` yet).

Next steps:
1) I can check Render status/logs via the Render MCP (requires workspace selection) and retry the health check.
2) Proceed to the next spec.
