Using skills: read-context (load constitution/AGENTS) and speckit-implement (Ralph loop).

I implemented spec 54 changes (audio parser + `AudioResponse` UI, baseline TTS docs/tool updates, audio parser tests) and marked the spec COMPLETE with `NR_OF_TRIES=1`. I haven’t run tests or proceeded to commit/deploy yet.

I hit an unexpected workspace state: `git status` shows many pre-existing edits/deletions/untracked files (e.g., `.gitignore`, constitution, baseline READMEs/config, gateway settings, scripts, lots of specs, and several untracked dirs). Per instructions I need your direction before continuing. How should I proceed?

1) Continue and stage only the files I changed for spec 54  
2) Include all current changes in the next commit  
3) Pause and clean/resolve the workspace first  

Also: I haven’t run `test-all`/`visual-test`/`commit-push`/`deploy-watch`/`notify-telegram` yet because of this unexpected repo state.
