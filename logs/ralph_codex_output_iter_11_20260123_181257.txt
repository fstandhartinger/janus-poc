Expanded the competition architecture coverage and benchmark integration to fully match spec 05, and marked the spec complete. Updates are in `ui/src/app/competition/components/ArchitectureOverview.tsx`, `ui/src/app/competition/components/BenchRunner.tsx`, and `specs/competition/05_architecture_overview.md`.

**Changes**
- `ui/src/app/competition/components/ArchitectureOverview.tsx`: full architecture diagram, request flow with sequence diagram, platform service cards with endpoints/examples, and security model with egress controls.
- `ui/src/app/competition/components/BenchRunner.tsx`: added scoring flow diagram, benchmark flow steps, transparency list, and expanded local run commands.
- `specs/competition/05_architecture_overview.md`: status set to COMPLETE.

**Tests**
- `cd gateway && pytest` (pass; PendingDeprecationWarning about `python_multipart`)
- `cd ui && npm test` (pass; Next.js workspace root warning)
- `cd gateway && mypy janus_gateway`
- `cd ui && npm run typecheck`

- `competition-mobile` (375x812)
- `competition-architecture-highlevel` (1920x1080)
- `competition-architecture-desktop` (1920x1080)

**Notes**
- Repo still has unrelated local changes (see `git status`); left untouched.

**Next steps**

2) Continue with spec 06 if you want the next iteration.
