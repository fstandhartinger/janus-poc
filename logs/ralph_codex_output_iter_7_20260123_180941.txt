Using speckit-implement to follow Ralph Build Mode and re-verify a completed spec.

Re-verified `specs/14_roadmap_milestones.md`:
- Tests mentioned in the spec: none to run.
- Acceptance criteria: milestones are concrete/testable; DoD reads unambiguous.
- Edge cases/regressions: none observed for this doc-only spec.
