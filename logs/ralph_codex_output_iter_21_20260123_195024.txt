Using skill `speckit-implement` to follow the Ralph loop. I ran `git status -sb` and found pre‑existing changes I didn’t make (modified: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `README.md`, `render.yaml`, `gateway/...`, `docs/...`, lots of renamed `baseline` → `baseline-agent-cli` files; untracked: `.codex/`, `logs/`, UI assets/components, etc.). Per the instructions I need your direction before proceeding. How would you like me to handle the existing changes—treat them as in‑progress and continue, or clean/stash them first?
