Using skills read-context (required context files) and speckit-implement (Ralph loop spec execution).

I hit a stop point because there are pre-existing uncommitted changes I didn’t make.
- Re-verification target: `specs/22_ui_polish.md` (random pick).
- Gateway tests: `pytest` passed (23 tests); `mypy janus_gateway` passed.
- UI tests: `npm test` (Playwright) passed after stopping a running `next dev` server on port 3000.
- UI typecheck failed: `TS2307` cannot find module `./BenchRunner` from `ui/src/app/competition/components/index.ts`.
- `git status` shows existing changes in multiple files (e.g. `README.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `ui/src/app/competition/components/BenchRunner.tsx`, `ui/src/app/competition/components/ArchitectureOverview.tsx`, plus untracked `ui/src/app/competition/components/CompetitionOverview.tsx`).

How would you like me to proceed?
1) Continue in the current dirty worktree and fix the typecheck issue.  
2) Pause while you clean/commit the existing changes.  
3) Something else you prefer.
