Using skill `speckit-implement` to follow the Ralph build loop; skipping `read-context` because `speckit-implement` already requires the same context files and I’ve read them.

I ran `git status -sb` and found pre-existing changes I didn’t make (modified: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `baseline/janus_baseline/*`, `baseline/tests/test_complexity.py`, `specs/11_chat_ui.md`, `specs/25_llm_complexity_second_pass.md`, `specs/competition/02_description_and_scoring.md`, `ui/src/app/chat/page.tsx`, `ui/src/app/globals.css`; untracked: `.claude/commands/*`, `.codex/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, `logs/`, `ui/public/Janus_God_and_Bull_Video_Generation.mp4*`, `ui/src/app/competition/components/CompetitionOverview.tsx`).  

How would you like me to proceed—treat these as in-progress and continue with Spec 26, or pause to clean/stash/inspect them first?
